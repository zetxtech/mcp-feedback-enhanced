## 🎯 Why Use This Tool?

By guiding AI assistants to confirm with users rather than making speculative high-cost tool calls, this module can significantly reduce the number of paid requests on platforms like Cursor. In some cases, it can consolidate up to 25 tool calls into a single feedback-oriented request, saving resources and improving performance.

## 📝 Prompt Engineering Setup

For best results, add the following custom prompts to your AI assistant (e.g., in Cursor's rules or prompts):

### Basic Prompt
> Whenever you want to ask a question, be sure to call MCP `mcp-feedback-enhanced`.  
> Whenever you're about to complete a user request, call MCP `mcp-feedback-enhanced` instead of ending the process directly.  
> Continue calling MCP until the user's feedback is empty, then end the request.

### Complete Rules Example
```
# MCP Interactive Feedback Rules

1. During any process, task, or conversation, whether asking, responding, or completing stage tasks, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
2. When receiving user feedback, if feedback content is not empty, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced again and adjust behavior based on feedback.
3. Only when user explicitly indicates "end" or "no more interaction needed" can you stop calling MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced, then the process is complete.
4. Unless receiving end command, all steps must repeatedly call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
```

This ensures your AI assistant uses this MCP server to request user feedback before marking tasks as complete.

## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1: uvx Installation (Recommended)

**This is the simplest method, no need to manually manage dependencies or virtual environments:**

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   pip install uv

   # Linux/Mac
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Test Installation**
   ```bash
   # View version info (recommend using @latest for latest version)
   uvx mcp-feedback-enhanced@latest version

   # Run tests
   uvx mcp-feedback-enhanced@latest test

   # Persistent test mode (can actually test in browser)
   uvx mcp-feedback-enhanced@latest test --persistent
   ```

### Method 2: Install from Source (Developers)

Suitable for users who need to modify code or contribute to development:

1. **Get the Code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Minidoracat/mcp-feedback-enhanced.git
   cd mcp-feedback-enhanced
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Test Installation**
   ```bash
   # Basic functionality test
   uv run python -m mcp_feedback_enhanced test

   uv run python -m mcp_feedback_enhanced test --persistent
   ```

4. **Run MCP Server**
   ```bash
   uv run python -m mcp_feedback_enhanced
   ```

## ⚙️ AI Assistant Configuration

### Recommended Configuration (using uvx)

Configure custom MCP server in Cursor settings, or manually edit `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-feedback-enhanced": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-feedback-enhanced@latest"
      ],
      "timeout": 600,
      "autoApprove": [
        "interactive_feedback"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative Configuration (running from source)

If you need to use source version or want to customize environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-feedback-enhanced": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-feedback-enhanced",
        "run",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "mcp_feedback_enhanced"
      ],
      "timeout": 600,
      "env": {
        "FORCE_WEB": "true",
        "MCP_DEBUG": "false"
      },
      "autoApprove": [

**Q: Web UI won't start**  
A: Ensure firewall allows local port access, or try setting `FORCE_WEB=true` environment variable.
